# Runbook

## Incident Tiers & Escalation
- HighErrorRate/HighLatency -> Sev2; BreakerOpenTooLong -> Sev2; DLQSizeHighCrit -> Sev1.

## P1 -- Payment Failover
### Trigger
- Circuit breaker for payment provider (e.g., Midtrans) trips: payment_circuit_open alert fires.
- Payment circuit metrics show the provider is unavailable; `/health/ready` only checks the database and Redis.

### Impact
- New checkouts fail at the payment step; existing paid orders are unaffected.
- Users see "Payment temporarily unavailable" with retry guidance.

### Diagnosis
1. Check provider status page / Midtrans dashboard.
2. Inspect toko_http_request_duration_ms for /checkout -> p99 spike.
3. Verify payment_circuit_open metric = 1 in Prometheus.
4. Check the recent deploy or configuration change for payment credentials.

### Mitigation
- Immediate: Disable checkout at the storefront or ingress while the provider is unavailable; this repository has no runtime `PAYMENT_ENABLED` flag.
- Failover: If a secondary provider is configured (e.g., Xendit), update `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=xendit` and its credentials, then roll out the change.
- Workaround: Instruct users to use bank transfer (VA) which may route through different integration path.

### Resolution
- Root-cause: provider outage / bad credentials / rate limit.
- Reset circuit: breakers transition out of the open state automatically after their configured interval; redeploy after correcting credentials or provider configuration if an immediate reset is required.
- Verify that a smoke checkout succeeds before restoring normal traffic.

### Postmortem Template
- Timeline (UTC): detection -> mitigation -> resolution.
- Affected users / revenue impact.
- Action items: circuit tuning, provider SLA negotiation, secondary provider testing.

## P2 -- Flash Sale Exhaustion
### Trigger
- flash_sale_stock_depleted alert fires or admin notices campaign sold out early.
- toko_flash_sale_stock_remaining metric hits 0 for active campaign items.

### Impact
- Campaign shows "Sold Out" prematurely or before scheduled end.
- Customer complaints / support tickets spike.

### Diagnosis
1. GET /api/v1/admin/flash-sales/{id} -> check items[].stock vs items[].stockLimit.
2. Query orders table for flash_sale_id = campaign ID; count paid orders per item.
3. Check for race condition: concurrent checkout requests exceeded stock reservation (review checkout service reservation logic).

### Mitigation
- Extend stock (if inventory allows): PATCH /admin/flash-sales/{id} with updated items[].stockLimit.
- Pause campaign: PATCH /admin/flash-sales/{id} with status: ENDED to stop new orders.
- Communicate: Post banner on storefront; notify waitlist if feature exists.

### Resolution
- If oversold: decide honour / refund per business policy.
- If undersold (bug): fix reservation logic (optimistic lock / Redis atomic decr), redeploy.
- Re-open campaign with corrected stock if within schedule.

### Postmortem Template
- Timeline (UTC).
- Units oversold/undersold per SKU.
- Revenue impact & customer comms sent.
- Action items: load test flash-sale path, add chaos test for concurrent reservation.

## P3 -- Tenant Onboarding
### Trigger
- New tenant row inserted via admin API or migration; tenant record exists but storefront returns 404 / no products.

### Impact
- Tenant cannot access admin; storefront shows "Store not found" on subdomain.

### Diagnosis
1. SELECT * FROM tenants WHERE slug = '<tenant-slug>' -> verify status = 'active', domain set.
2. Check DNS: dig <tenant-slug>.toko.com -> CNAME to wildcard cert target.
3. Verify tenant_resolver middleware logs: X-Tenant-ID header / subdomain extraction.
4. Check Redis cache: the configured tenant cache prefix contains the expected tenant mapping.

### Mitigation
- DNS propagation: Wait TTL (typically 60-300s); flush local DNS.
- Cache invalidation: restart API pods or evict the affected tenant cache keys directly; there is no public cache-flush endpoint.
- Status correction: PATCH /admin/tenants/{id} with status: active if stuck in pending.

### Resolution
- Ensure migration 000018+ seeds default tenant correctly.
- Add health endpoint /health/tenant/<slug> for automated verification.
- Document required DNS records in onboarding checklist.

### Postmortem Template
- Timeline (UTC).
- Root cause: DNS / cache / DB status / middleware config.
- Tenants affected.
- Action items: automated tenant verification job, onboarding runbook in admin UI.

## DLQ Replay
- Gunakan endpoint admin replay per-id atau batch (kind); pastikan root cause diatasi sebelum replay massal.

## Scaling
- Tambah replicas API/worker; pantau queue_depth & webhook latency p95.

## Drain & Rolling Update
- Set readiness=false, tunggu job selesai, deploy, verifikasi health & alerts clear.

## Migration 000040 lock timeout
Migration `000040_flash_sale_order_items_item_index` builds `idx_flash_sale_order_items_item` with a plain `CREATE INDEX` under `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '5s'`. `deploy.yml` runs it while the old api/worker still serve checkout traffic, so a long settlement transaction on `flash_sale_order_items` can make it time out.
- Symptom: the deploy job fails with `up: migration failed: canceling statement due to lock timeout`; any later `up` reports `Dirty database version 40. Fix and force version.`. The restart steps do not run, so the old binaries keep serving. No index is left behind (the whole file runs in one implicit transaction).
- Recovery on the host: `./bin/migrate.new force 39` (or `./bin/migrate force 39`; both work), then re-run the deploy workflow off-peak. If you run `./bin/migrate.new up` by hand instead, finish the remaining deploy steps too: `mv bin/api.new bin/api && mv bin/worker.new bin/worker && mv bin/migrate.new bin/migrate`, then `sudo systemctl restart toko-api toko-worker`.
- Do **not** use `./bin/migrate up`: `deploy.yml` renames `migrate.new` to `migrate` only after a successful migration, so after a failed deploy `bin/migrate` is the old binary, which embeds migrations only up to 39, and `up` is a silent no-op.

## Migrations 000043/000044 lock timeout
`000043_payments_partial_refunds` adds the `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` label to `payment_status`, the `payments.refunded_amount` column and a `NOT VALID` CHECK; `000044_refunds_lifecycle` validates that CHECK and adds the refund lifecycle columns (`provider_status`, `failure_reason`, `settled_at`, `updated_at`, `attempt`, `payment_id`) to `refunds`. Every file starts with `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '5s'`. `payments` is hot (checkout, webhooks, status polling) and `deploy.yml` runs these while the old api/worker still serve traffic, so a long transaction on `payments` or `refunds` can make them time out instead of queueing every payment query.
- Symptom: the deploy job fails with `up: migration failed: canceling statement due to lock timeout`; any later `up` reports `Dirty database version 43` (or `44`) `. Fix and force version.`. The restart steps do not run, so the old binaries keep serving. Nothing from the failing file is applied (each file runs in one implicit transaction); 000043 applied in full if the dirty version is 44.
- Recovery on the host: `./bin/migrate.new force 42` when dirty at 43, `./bin/migrate.new force 43` when dirty at 44 (if integration renumbers these migrations, force to the version immediately before the dirty one), then re-run the deploy workflow off-peak. Same manual-finish steps as for 000040 if you run `./bin/migrate.new up` by hand.
- Do **not** use `./bin/migrate up` after a failed deploy: it is the old binary and does not embed these migrations.
- Rolling back 000043 cannot remove the `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` enum label (PostgreSQL limitation); the down migration resets such payments to `PAID`. Re-running up is safe.
- A refund stuck with an unknown gateway outcome (`refunds.status='PENDING'`, `provider_status='UNKNOWN'`, `settled_at IS NULL`) blocks `PATCH /admin/returns/{id}` with `409 RETURN_REFUND_PENDING`. Resolve it by retrying the refund (it checks or re-sends the same gateway key), or, after confirming in the gateway dashboard that no refund exists, set the row to `status='FAILED'` by hand.
